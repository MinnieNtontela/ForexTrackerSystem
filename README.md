# ForexTrackerSystem
I'm a student with a strong passion for data engineering, and this project reflects my curiosity and commitment to learning real-world applications. Using Python, I fetch live forex data and apply common trading indicators to generate intelligent buy/sell signals.
This project allows me to:
- Practice API integration and data handling
- Explore financial data analysis techniques
- Improve modular coding and CLI feedback systems
My goal is to deepen my skills in data processing, pipeline design, and algorithmic logicâ€”while building something that simulates real-time decision making.
